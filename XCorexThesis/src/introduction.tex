\section{Motivation}
	Software development is a very complex process in which every component of the
system must developed according to a strict set of guidelines. Every component
and its architecture is assets based on different metrics which are implemented
by software analysis tools. One major problem with this approach is that you
have to be a licensed statistical interpreter to fully understand the abstract
numbers that are ouputed by the tool. Another major problem is that in most
cases the use of the tools comes to late.\cite{tools:inCode}. And the biggest
problem yet is that we need very many metrics to properly evaluate our items,
but for this we also need a lot of metrics and wasted time in running them.
	For the latter problem there is an obvious solution: unite all of them
in a single platform. This is not an easy task as you might think.
