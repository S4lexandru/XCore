	In the future I would like to extend the framework to be integrate with the
incremental build systems that are present in major IDEs such as Eclipse and
IntelliJ. Currently when using the tool and have added or removed entities that
are annotated with elements from the framework you will need to rebuild the
entire projects. This is due to the lack of partial information provided by the
compiler when incremental builds are used. 

	Major improvements would be the possibility of integrating multiple models in
the same tool. For example we may want to design a software tool that uses some
model as JDT, but we would like to take advantage of the Wallace model also
(because we want to provider a larger acceptance or optimize our application).\\
	Another improvement would be the possibility of sandboxing new add-ons. When
we develop a tool we usually develop a core, formed from a series of elementary
elements which rarely are changed, and add as we need different plugins. It
will be great for the user if he can develop the new plugin in isolation with respect 
to other developments so it doesn't interfere with them and also if it doesn't
affect the core.
